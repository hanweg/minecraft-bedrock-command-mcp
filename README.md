- **Special**: `air` (removes blocks), `barrier` (invisible blocks)# Minecraft Bedrock MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers through natural language commands.

![MCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP-Compatible-blue)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10%2B-yellow)

## üéØ Overview

This MCP server bridges the gap between AI assistants and Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers, allowing you to:

- **Manage your server** through natural language commands
- **Control player actions** (teleportation, item giving, etc.)
- **Monitor server status** and player activity in real-time
- **Automate world management** (time, weather, etc.)

Unlike Minecraft Java Edition which uses RCON, Bedrock Edition requires direct process communication, which this server handles seamlessly.

- Give items to players
- Send messages to players

### üåç World Control
- Set time of day (day, night, noon, midnight, or specific ticks)
- Control weather (clear, rain, thunder)
- Execute any Bedrock server command

### üèóÔ∏è Building & Construction
- **Block Placement**: Place individual blocks with `setblock`
- **Area Filling**: Fill large areas with blocks using `fill` command
- **Structure Cloning**: Copy and paste structures with `clone`
- **Structure Templates**: Save and load reusable structure templates
- **Quick Buildings**: Create common structures (houses, towers, walls, pyramids)
- **Entity Spawning**: Summon mobs, items, and other entities
- **Particle Effects**: Create visual effects and particles

### üìä Monitoring

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server**
   - Download from [minecraft.net/download/server/bedrock](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock)
   - Extract and configure your server

2. **Python 3.10+**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher
   ```

3. **MCP Python SDK**
   ```bash
   pip install mcp
   # or
   uv add mcp
   ```

### Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Save** `bedrock_mcp_server.py` to your desired location
3. **Make it executable** (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x bedrock_mcp_server.py
   ```

### Configuration

#### 1. Test Your Bedrock Server
First, ensure your Bedrock server runs independently:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/bedrock-server
./bedrock_server  # or bedrock_server.exe on Windows
```

#### 2. Configure Claude Desktop
Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minecraft-bedrock": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/bedrock_mcp_server.py",
        "--server-path",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/BEDROCK-SERVER-DIRECTORY",
        "--auto-start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Use absolute paths, not relative ones!

#### Example Paths:
- **macOS/Linux**: `/Users/username/minecraft/bedrock-server`
- **Windows**: `C:\\Users\\username\\minecraft\\bedrock-server`

#### Example Claude Desktop Config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minecraft-bedrock": {
      "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PROJECT/bedrock_mcp_server.py",
        "--server-path",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/BEDROCK-SERVER-DIRECTORY",
        "--auto-start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "minecraft-bedrock": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YourName\\minecraft-bedrock-mcp\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:\\Users\\YourName\\minecraft-bedrock-mcp\\bedrock_mcp_server.py",
        "--server-path",
        "C:\\MinecraftServer",
        "--auto-start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage

#### Starting the MCP Server

**Option 1: Auto-start Bedrock Server (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Windows
python bedrock_mcp_server.py --server-path C:\MinecraftServer --auto-start
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
python bedrock_mcp_server.py --server-path /path/to/bedrock-server --auto-start
```

**Option 2: Connect to Running Server**
```powershell
# Start your Bedrock server first, then:
# Windows
python bedrock_mcp_server.py --server-path C:\MinecraftServer
```

```bash
# Linux/macOS
python bedrock_mcp_server.py --server-path /path/to/bedrock-server
```

#### Restart Claude Desktop
After configuring, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Connect
```
Error: Bedrock server executable not found
```
**Solution**: Check that your `--server-path` points to the directory containing `bedrock_server` or `bedrock_server.exe`

#### Commands Not Working
```
Error: Server is not running
```
**Solution**: 
- Use `--auto-start` flag, or
- Start your Bedrock server manually first

#### Claude Can't See the Tools
**Check**:
1. Claude Desktop config file syntax is valid JSON
2. Paths are absolute, not relative
3. You've restarted Claude Desktop after configuration changes

#### Permission Errors
```
Error: Permission denied
```
**Solution**:
- Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x bedrock_mcp_server.py`
- Run with appropriate permissions for the Bedrock server directory

### Debug Mode

Add logging to see what's happening:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Log Locations
- **MCP Server logs**: Console output where you ran the script
- **Bedrock Server logs**: Server console or log files in server directory

## üîí Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes**:

- This MCP server can execute **any** command on your Minecraft server
- Only use with **trusted AI assistants** and secure environments
- The `stop` command will **shut down your server** - use carefully
- Consider running the Bedrock server in a **containerized environment**
- Monitor server logs for **unexpected commands**

### Recommendations:
1. **Backup your world** before first use
2. **Test in a development environment** first  
3. **Use server permissions** to limit potential damage
4. **Monitor command execution** through logs

## ü§ù Contributing
